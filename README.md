The Tourist Attraction Locator app is a webpage that allows users to browse a list of attractions scraped off google based on user input and redirects user to single activity page
that scrapes TripAdvisor for title, reviews, address, ratings, open hours, and description.

Allows users to sort through pages of attractions and write reviews on an attractions. User can save the activity to view later. An activity page linked on the Navbar takes user
to page that dynamically displays all user saved activities due to MySQL. Allows user to delete activity, or a link redirecting user to that activity page to view more information.
Implemented a chatbot that allows user to skip the initial search and allows user to enter any query and the bot will automatically redirect user to that activity page.
